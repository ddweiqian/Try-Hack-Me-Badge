# What is Detection Engineering?

## Detection Engineering

Cybersecurity is rapidly advancing due to technological progress. As a result, adversary actions are also evolving, making cyber attacks increasingly frequent and sophisticated, challenging security teams to keep up. Therefore, new mindsets and practices are essential for security teams to match adversaries' pace. This is where detection engineering plays a crucial role.

Detection engineering involves continuously developing and operating threat intelligence analytics to detect potentially malicious activities or misconfigurations in your environment. It demands a cultural shift, requiring all security teams and management to align in building robust, threat-informed defense systems.

## Detection Types

Threat detection can be categorized into two main perspectives, each with two subcategories:

**Environment-based Detection**: This focuses on changes within an environment, based on predefined configurations and baseline activities. It includes:

1. Configuration Detection

2. Modelling

**Threat-based Detection**: This targets elements related to adversary activities, such as tactics, tools, and artifacts that reveal their actions. It comprises:

1. Indicators

2. Threat Behaviour Detections

### Configuration Detection

This detection method utilizes existing knowledge of the environment and infrastructure to pinpoint misalignments. It spans multiple domains, such as network, asset, and identity.

Configuration detection offers several benefits and faces certain challenges:

### Modelling

This threat detection method involves setting up baseline operations and activities, and then noting any deviations. The core idea is that malicious activity can be distinguished from benign activity.

This approach entails creating an asset or activity profile that captures baseline events, time frames, and data thresholds. An in-depth exploration of baselining will be covered in the next task.

The benefits and challenges of this detection method include:

### Indicator Detection

Indicators are bits of information that provide context and state of an element or entity. There are **good** indicators, which identify legitimate activities or resources (like those in whitelists), and **bad** indicators, which pinpoint suspicious or malicious resources (such as blacklists or malware IPs).

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are often derived from investigations into malicious activities. By observing and analyzing these threat activities, analysts can develop detections using these identified indicators and adjust them as adversarial tactics evolve.

This detection method comes with its own set of benefits and challenges:

### Threat Behaviour Detection

This method involves analysts examining an adversary's Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to detect attacks, rather than relying solely on specific indicators. This approach enhances scalability in detection efforts.

By focusing on threat behaviour detection, analysts can more efficiently respond to threats and mitigate them without spending excessive time and resources on understanding the triggers for alerts. Additionally, this detection method can be integrated with established workflows and playbooks, providing best practices to follow during investigations.

This detection method also comes with its own set of benefits and challenges:

Combining these forms of detection results in more robust defence systems. For example, model-based detection can be strengthened with expert-led configuration detection to reduce the chances of having false positives throwing alerts.

## Detection as Code (DaC)

Detection as Code is an organized method for creating detection systems by using best practices from software engineering. This approach treats detection processes and logic as code, enabling scalability to adapt to evolving environments and adversary tactics.

DaC introduces a code-centric workflow that integrates essential elements from Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) workflows, such as:

1. **Version Control**: Many SIEMs and EDR products lack the ability to track changes to alerts and their definitions. Incorporating version control allows for quick review, testing, and accountability of detection rules and processes, leading to higher-quality detections.

2. **Automation Workflows**: Adopting CI/CD workflows facilitates automated detection testing, enabling swift transitions and production deployments.

Detection as Code offers several advantages:

1. **Customizable and Flexible Detections**: Utilizing common languages for detections, like Sigma and YARA, allows DaC to be vendor-neutral and deployable across various SIEM, EDR, and XDR solutions.

2. **Test-Driven Development**: Quality testing of detection code helps identify blind spots and false positives early in the process, enhancing detection effectiveness. This approach also improves detection quality and ensures thorough documentation.

3. **Team Collaboration**: CI/CD workflows reduce isolation between security teams and promote collaboration through the coding process.

4. **Code Reusability**: As detection patterns develop, engineers can reuse code for similar functions across different detections, accelerating the detection process by avoiding the need to start from scratch.

# Detection Engineering Methodologies

## Detection Gap Analysis

The initial step involves examining the environment to pinpoint key areas where organizations can enhance threat detection. This process, also known as threat modeling, can be approached in the following ways:

**Reactive**: Reviewing recent internal incident reports, learning from the attacks, and identifying areas where detection was missed.

**Proactive**: Utilizing the ATT&CK framework and various threat intelligence sources to map out potential attack areas and the TTPs that adversaries might use against your environment.

Note: In this context, threat modeling differs from the detection type discussed earlier.

## Datasource Identification and Log Collection

With knowledge of relevant threat actors, TTPs, and potential risks the organization may face, it's crucial to identify relevant data sources associated with these risks. This helps determine which logs are currently available to aid in defining detections and identifying any missing or necessary logs.

### Baseline Creation

Before leveraging collected information about adversaries, their TTPs, and any malicious behavior, security analysts need to understand normal behavior and establish security baselines. This ongoing process requires participation from all departments within the organization.

Setting up security baselines involves identifying the various types of devices operating within the organization based on their OS, services, and functions. Security baselines can be categorized into:

**High-level**: Broad, OS-independent standards guided by a specified security policy.

**Technical**: OS-based configuration standards outlining different system functions and intended behaviors, such as OS hardening policies, network activities, IAM policies, and application policies.

### Log Collection

After identifying and prioritizing baselines and internal data sources, the next step is collecting logs and metadata useful for threat detection. Depending on the infrastructure, a centralized system may aggregate all logs using network sensors for network data and services like Sysmon for host data.

## Rule Writing

Based on the infrastructure and SIEM services, detection rules need to be written and tested against data sources. Detection rules evaluate abnormal patterns in logged events. Network traffic can be assessed using Snort rules, while Yara rules can evaluate file data. For more information, explore the Snort and Yara rooms.

As part of the Detection Engineering module, we'll explore Sigma, a generic signature language used to write detection rules against log files.

## Deployment, Automation & Tuning

Tested detection rules must be deployed in a live environment for assessment. Over time, these detections need to be modified and updated to account for changes in attack vectors, patterns, or the environment. This process improves the quality of detections and encourages continuous refinement.

# Detection Engineering Frameworks 2

[Alerting and Detection Strategy Framework](https://github.com/palantir/alerting-detection-strategy-framework)

**Palantir's ADS Framework** was developed to guide the documentation of detection content, addressing challenges such as alert fatigue and apathy due to ineffective detection alerts. This framework aims to create effective detections and alerts, ensuring a structured approach.

The ADS Framework follows a strict sequence that detection engineers must adhere to before deploying detection rules into production. The stages include:

1. **Goal**: Explains the purpose behind setting up the alert and the type of behavior that needs to be detected.

2. **Categorisation**: Maps the detection to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, offering analysts insights on the TTPs for investigation and the parts of the kill chain where the ADS will be applied.

3. **Strategy Abstract**: Provides an overview of how the detection strategy will function, detailing what the alert will look for, the data sources, enrichment resources, and ways to reduce false positives.

4. **Technical Context**: Describes the technical environment for the detection, providing analysts and responders with all necessary information to understand the alert. This should align with the platforms and tools used for threat alerts.

5. **Blind Spots and Assumptions**: Identifies any potential issues where suspicious activities might not trigger the strategy. Clarifies how the ADS might fail or be bypassed.

6. **False Positives**: Lists scenarios where alerts might be triggered by misconfigurations or benign activities, aiding in configuring SIEM to target only relevant threats.

7. **Validation**: Details the steps required to produce a true-positive event that would trigger the alert. This is akin to a unit test, which could be a script or scenario used to generate an alert. Effective validation includes:

1) Developing a plan for a true-positive outcome

2) Documenting the process

3) Testing and triggering an alert in a controlled environment

Validating the strategy that triggered the alert

8. **Priority**: Sets up the alerting levels with criteria for preferences, separate from the alerting levels shown through SIEM.

9. **Response**: Provides guidance on how to triage and investigate a detection alert, helping analysts and responders prevent serious consequences.
