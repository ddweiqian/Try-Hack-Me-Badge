# Introduction to MITRE

For those new to cybersecurity, MITRE(MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)) might not be familiar. Even experienced professionals might primarily recognize MITRE for its CVEs ([Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/)) list, a key resource for identifying exploits for specific vulnerabilities. However, MITRE's research spans various fields beyond cybersecurity, all aimed at enhancing the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation. These fields include artificial intelligence, health informatics, and space security, among others.

According to [Mitre.org](https://www.mitre.org/who-we-are): "At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation."

In this discussion, we will focus on other initiatives and research by the U.S.-based non-profit MITRE Corporation that benefit the cybersecurity community, specifically:

ATT&CKÂ® (**A**dversarial **T**actics, **T**echniques, and **C**ommon **K**nowledge) Framework

CAR (**C**yber **A**nalytics **R**epository) Knowledge Base

ENGAGE (not an acronym)

D3FEND (**D**etection, **D**enial, and **D**isruption **F**ramework **E**mpowering **N**etwork **D**efense)

AEP (**A**TT&CK **E**mulation **P**lans)
