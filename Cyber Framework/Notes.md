# Introduction to MITRE

For those new to cybersecurity, MITRE(MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)) might not be familiar. Even experienced professionals might primarily recognize MITRE for its CVEs ([Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/)) list, a key resource for identifying exploits for specific vulnerabilities. However, MITRE's research spans various fields beyond cybersecurity, all aimed at enhancing the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation. These fields include artificial intelligence, health informatics, and space security, among others.

According to [Mitre.org](https://www.mitre.org/who-we-are): "At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation."

In this discussion, we will focus on other initiatives and research by the U.S.-based non-profit MITRE Corporation that benefit the cybersecurity community, specifically:

ATT&CKÂ® (**A**dversarial **T**actics, **T**echniques, and **C**ommon **K**nowledge) Framework

CAR (**C**yber **A**nalytics **R**epository) Knowledge Base

ENGAGE (not an acronym)

D3FEND (**D**etection, **D**enial, and **D**isruption **F**ramework **E**mpowering **N**etwork **D**efense)

AEP (**A**TT&CK **E**mulation **P**lans)

# Basic Terminology

Let's take a moment to go over some common terms you'll encounter when dealing with frameworks and threat intelligence.

**APT** stands for **Advanced Persistent Threat**. This term refers to a team, group, or even a nation-state that conducts prolonged attacks against organizations or countries. The word "advanced" might be misleading, suggesting that these groups possess some kind of super-weapon like a zero-day exploit. However, this is not the case. As we'll discuss later, the techniques used by APT groups are often quite common and can be detected with the proper measures in place. 

An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.

TTP stands for **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures**. Here's what each term means:

**Tactic**: The goal or objective of the adversary.

**Technique**: The method the adversary uses to achieve the goal or objective.

**Procedure**: The way the technique is carried out.
