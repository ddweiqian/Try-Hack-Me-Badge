# Why logs: Logs as Evidence of Historical Activity

## The Essence of Data: logs
Just as the rings in a tree reveal its life story—thicker rings for good years and thinner for challenging ones—a digital log documents the history of system activity. Both represent the fundamental principle of growth over time, serving as living records in their respective realms, whether physical or digital.

In the digital domain, every interaction with a computer system—such as authentication attempts, authorization grants, file accesses, network connections, and system errors—creates a digital footprint in the form of logs.

## Components of a Digital Log
Logs record events within a system, providing a comprehensive account of activities. These can include user logins, file accesses, system errors, network connections, and changes to data or system configurations.

Although the specifics may vary by log type, a typical log entry contains:

1. A timestamp indicating when the event was logged

2. The name of the system or application generating the log entry

3. The type of event that occurred

4. Additional details, such as the user initiating the event or the IP address of the device involved

This information is typically stored in a log file, which aggregates entries of system activities over time. Due to the continuous and rapid pace of digital interactions, log files can grow significantly in size depending on the activities logged.

## The Power of Logs: Contextual Correlation
A single log entry may seem minor on its own. However, when log data is aggregated, analyzed, and cross-referenced with other information sources, it becomes a powerful investigative tool. Logs can provide answers to critical questions about an event, such as:

1. What happened?

2. When did it happen?

3. Where did it happen?

4. Who is responsible?

5. Were their actions successful?

6. What was the outcome of their actions?

# What logs: Types, Formats and Standards

## Log Types

Different log types provide unique insights into a system's operation, performance, and security. Here, we'll focus on the most common log types, which cover around 80% of typical use cases.

### Common Log Types:
Application Logs: Include messages about specific applications, covering status updates, errors, warnings, etc.

Audit Logs: Capture activities related to operational procedures, essential for regulatory compliance.

Security Logs: Document security events such as logins, permissions changes, firewall activity, and more.

Server Logs: Encompass various logs generated by a server, including system, event, error, and access logs.

System Logs: Detail kernel activities, system errors, boot sequences, and hardware status.

Network Logs: Track network traffic, connections, and other network-related events.

Database Logs: Record activities within a database system, including queries and updates.

Web Server Logs: Capture requests processed by a web server, including URLs, response codes, etc.

### Importance of Log Analysis:

Understanding these log types, their formats, and standards is crucial for effective log analysis. This knowledge allows analysts to efficiently parse, interpret, and derive insights from log data, aiding in troubleshooting, performance optimization, incident response, and threat hunting.

## Log Standards

A log standard consists of guidelines or specifications that dictate how logs should be generated, transmitted, and stored. These standards can include specific log formats and also cover various aspects of logging, such as the events to be logged, secure transmission methods, and retention periods.

### Examples of Log Standards:

[Common Event Expression (CEE)](https://cee.mitre.org/): Developed by MITRE, this standard provides a common structure for log data, making it easier to generate, transmit, store, and analyze logs.

[OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html): A guide for developers on building application logging mechanisms, particularly for security logging.

[Syslog Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424): A standard for message logging that separates the software generating messages from the system storing them and the software reporting and analyzing them.

[NIST Special Publication 800-92](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-92.pdf): Offers guidance on computer security log management.

[Azure Monitor Logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs): Provides guidelines for log monitoring on Microsoft Azure.

[Google Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs): Offers guidelines for logging on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Logging/Concepts/loggingoverview.htm): Provides guidelines for logging on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

[Virginia Tech - Standard for Information Technology Logging](https://it.vt.edu/content/dam/it_vt_edu/policies/Standard_for_Information_Technology_Logging.pdf): A sample log review and compliance guideline.

Understanding these standards is crucial for effective log management, ensuring that logs are consistently and securely handled across different systems and platforms.

# How Log: Collection, Management, and Centralisation

## Log Collection

Log collection is a crucial part of log analysis, involving the aggregation of logs from various sources like servers, network devices, software, and databases.

To accurately reflect a chronological sequence of events, it's essential to maintain precise system time during logging. Using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) helps achieve this synchronization and ensures the integrity of the log timelines.

This foundational step ensures that a security analyst has a comprehensive data set to review. Here's a simple step-by-step process, emphasizing the need to prioritize log collection based on significant information:

1. Identify Sources: List all potential log sources, such as servers, databases, applications, and network devices.

2. Choose a Log Collector: Select a log collector tool or software that aligns with your infrastructure, such as Rsyslog

3. Configure Collection Parameters: Enable time synchronization through NTP to maintain accurate timelines, set parameters for which events to log and their intervals, and prioritize based on importance.

4. Test Collection: Run a test to ensure logs are collected appropriately from all sources.

By following these steps, people can ensure effective log collection and accurate log analysis.
