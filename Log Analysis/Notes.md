# Why logs: Logs as Evidence of Historical Activity

## The Essence of Data: logs
Just as the rings in a tree reveal its life story—thicker rings for good years and thinner for challenging ones—a digital log documents the history of system activity. Both represent the fundamental principle of growth over time, serving as living records in their respective realms, whether physical or digital.

In the digital domain, every interaction with a computer system—such as authentication attempts, authorization grants, file accesses, network connections, and system errors—creates a digital footprint in the form of logs.

## Components of a Digital Log
Logs record events within a system, providing a comprehensive account of activities. These can include user logins, file accesses, system errors, network connections, and changes to data or system configurations.

Although the specifics may vary by log type, a typical log entry contains:

1. A timestamp indicating when the event was logged

2. The name of the system or application generating the log entry

3. The type of event that occurred

4. Additional details, such as the user initiating the event or the IP address of the device involved

This information is typically stored in a log file, which aggregates entries of system activities over time. Due to the continuous and rapid pace of digital interactions, log files can grow significantly in size depending on the activities logged.

## The Power of Logs: Contextual Correlation
A single log entry may seem minor on its own. However, when log data is aggregated, analyzed, and cross-referenced with other information sources, it becomes a powerful investigative tool. Logs can provide answers to critical questions about an event, such as:

1. What happened?

2. When did it happen?

3. Where did it happen?

4. Who is responsible?

5. Were their actions successful?

6. What was the outcome of their actions?

# What logs : Types, Formats and Standards

## Log Types
