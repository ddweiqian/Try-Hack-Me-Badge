# Traffic Analysis Essentials

## Introduction
Network Security is a set of operations for protecting data, applications, devices and systems connected to the network. It is accepted as one of the significant subdomains of cyber security. It focuses on the system design, operation and management of the architecture/infrastructure to provide network accessibility, integrity, continuity and reliability. Traffic analysis (often called Network Traffic Analysis) is a subdomain of the Network Security domain, and its primary focus is investigating the network data to identify problems and anomalies. 
## Network Security and Network Data
### Network Security
The essential concern of Network Security focuses on two core concepts: authentication and authorisation. There are a variety of tools, technologies, and approaches to ensure and measure implementations of these two key concepts and go beyond to provide continuity and reliability. Network security operations contain three base control levels to ensure the maximum available security management.
**Base Network Security Control Levels:**

There are two main approaches and multiple elements under these control levels. The most common elements used in network security operations are explained below.

### Managed Security Services

Not every organisation has enough resources to create dedicated groups for specific security domains. There are plenty of reasons for this: budget, employee skillset, and organisation size could determine how security operations are handled. At this point, Managed Security Services (MSS) come up to fulfil the required effort to ensure/enhance security needs. MSS are services that have been outsourced to service providers. These service providers are called Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). Today, most MSS are time and cost effective, can be conducted in-house or outsourced, are easy to engage, and ease the management process. There are various elements of MSS, and the most common ones are explained below.
