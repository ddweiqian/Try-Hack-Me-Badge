# Try-Hack-Me-Badge

This journey is not just about hands-on practice but also consistency and resilience.

I earned my 7-days-streak badge in the first 9 consecutive days practice, then lost it as I did not answer any quesiton continuously for 2 consecutive days.
I have to begin from scratch.

On the second try, I earned my 26-days-streak with only 4-days-streak left to achieve the 30-days-streak badge. Then again I lost it for the same reason.
For the second time, I have to start from the very beginning to earn my badge.

Let's see what will happen...
